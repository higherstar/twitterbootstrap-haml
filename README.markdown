# Twitter Bootstrap Example Templates in Haml

A very simple [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) application where the example pages from the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) framework 
have been converted to [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/).

This original example templates used were current as of Bootstrap v2.0.0.

## Installation

```ruby
bundle install
rackup
```

You should now be able to view the application at [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).
